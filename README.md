#Week 2

In Week 2, I built and trained the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the dataset from Week 1. The data was preprocessed through image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve performance. The model was implemented using Python with TensorFlow/Keras in Google Colab to classify waste images into five categories — plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic. I fine-tuned the model parameters and evaluated its accuracy to ensure better classification results.

This week marks the model development phase, progressing toward a complete AI-based waste segregation system that supports recycling and promotes environmental sustainability.
